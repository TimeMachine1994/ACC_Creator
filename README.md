open the server folder and install "npm install mongoose nodemon express body-parser dotenv"
and in the root npm install svelte@latest 
also make sure you have mongodb running on it's default local host port
then you can npm run dev in the server folder and then npm run dev in the root folder
oh yeah and npm install tailwind inside the root, as well...
